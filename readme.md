# Expo starter

Has TypeScript, firebase, Eslint, prettier, React Navigation etc. set up. Very lightweight and slightly unopinionated.

```sh
git clone https://github.com/nandorojo/expo-starter-project <project-name>
cd <project-name>
yarn
yarn start
```

To use firebase:

**1. Add dependencies**

```sh
yarn add firebase @nandorojo/fuego
```

**2. Edit config in `src/firebase`**
